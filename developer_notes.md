CLAUDE IS NOT ALLOWED TO EDIT THIS FILE. CLAUDE MAY READ THIS FILE BUT MUST NOT EDIT IT.

These are my personal development notes.

# Version 0.1 2/1 - 
Claude struggles with some basic operations. This could be due to the limitations of the interface and deserves some experimentaiton. Challenges include;
1. Low quality renders of things like people, cats etc. Even when asked for higher resolution renderings, claude struggles. Dogs look barely dog like. People are simplistic.
2. Editing of drawings is tricky for claude. Drawing a blue blob and asking it to convert it to red - claude will fail. Draw a square and ask it to clean it up and it'll erase the wrong pixels and draw it back in the wrong color.
3. Sometimes technical drawings have something subtly wrong with them, not unlike hallucinations in image generators.
4. After adding shapes the drawing function slowed down a lot, it looks like Claude added an ACK somewhere and this could be one thing that slow down the socket interface.
